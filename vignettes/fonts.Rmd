The `trekfont` package contains 107 Star Trek fonts. These are not part of `rtrek` but `rtrek` offers a convenient function `st_font()` for previewing them.

Since accessing these fonts can easily be done directly and doing so is also not a significant purpose of `rtrek`, this function is only useful if you choose to install optional packages not otherwise required for `rtrek`.
These include `showtext`, `ggplot2`, and of course `trekfont`. As long as you have these packages installed, you do not need to load them explicitly in order to use `st_font()`.

If you call `st_font()` without passing the `family` argument, it will return a vector of all available font families.It does so with the font file extensions removed, in contrast to `trekfont::trekfonts`.
This function is only for previewing fonts.

```{r font1}
library(rtrek)
st_font()
```

```{r font2, eval=FALSE}
st_font("Khan")
```

Worf is here to guide your selections, though he has a bit of a one-track mind when it comes to Star Trek universe calligraphy.

The RStudio graphics device in Windows may not show the fonts. It is recommended you use the regular R GUI.

This font previewer does just that. If you want to install and use fonts from `trekfont`, just do so using `sysfonts` and `showtext`. See these packages for details.
