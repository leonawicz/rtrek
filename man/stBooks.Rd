\description{
A data frame with 783 rows and 11 columns containing metadata on Star Trek novels and other books taken directly from original books.
The data frame contains most of the novels but is not comprehensive and may be out of date temporarily whenever new novels are published.
It is largely complete through the end of 2017, though some older entries are still missing.
}
\details{
\code{stBooks}: There may be some irregularities or erroneous entries based on the imperfect methods use to compile the metadata,
but it is overall an accurate dataset.

The \code{nchap} column is largely accurate, but imperfect. Some entries suggest a book has an unusual number of chapters, but the parser is not perfect at determining what constitutes a chapter.
However, many of the books with unusually high numbers of chapters are not erroneous but rather indicate a reference book, omnibus or anthology, as opposed to a standard novel.
