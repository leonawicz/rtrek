\description{
Perform a Memory Alpha site search.
}
\details{
This function returns a data frame containing the title, truncated text
preview, and relative URL for the first page of search results. It does not
recursively collate search results through subsequent pages of results.
There could be an unexpectedly high number of pages of results depending on
the search query. Since the general nature of this search feature seems
relatively casual anyway, it aims only to provide a first page preview.
