\title{rtrek: Data analysis relating to Star Trek.}
\description{
The \code{rtrek} package contains a collection of Star Trek-themed datasets and R
functions to assist with their use. The package interfaces with the Star Trek
API (STAPI), Memory Alpha and Memory Beta to retrieve data, metadata and
other information relating to the Star Trek fictional universe.
}
\details{
The package also contains several local datasets covering a variety of topics
such as Star Trek timeline data, universe species data and geopolitical data.
Some of these are more information rich, while others are toy examples useful
for simple demonstrations. The bulk of Star Trek data is accessed from
external sources by API. A future version of \code{rtrek} will also include
summary datasets resulting from text mining analyses of Star Trek novels.
